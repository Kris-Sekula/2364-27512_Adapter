# 2364-27512_Adapter
Adapter to use EPROM as a replacement of PROM, commonly used for Commodore 64 KERNAL replacement. 

I use it with my EPROM Emulator. 

Inspired by SukkoPera/Open2327RomAdapter but with resistors placed on top layer to protect bottom layer from screwdriver that I often use to remove the EPROM from the socket. Added standard 2.54mm header for option extension of A13-A15 lines, solder pads nicely spaced to allow soldering of extention cable for switchable images.
